# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

In this project I created a random password generator using javaScript.  This website lets the user generate a random password of a submitted length by the user. The user may also select what types of characters may be in the password such as: lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numeric values, and special characters.

## Usage

This website is hosted at this link: https://smudge121.github.io/Password-Generator/
